---description: Analyze performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, suggest optimizations, and create a benchmark script
---# Goal
Read the code in the file at path: **${ARGUMENTS}**, perform a detailed analysis to **IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECK**, **Suggest optimizations** for the identified issues, and **Create a benchmark script** (e.g., using Node.js's `perf_hooks` or a library like `autocannon` or `benchmark.js`) to measure the impact of the suggested changes.

## User Input
File path to analyze: **${ARGUMENTS}**

## üîç Explanation
This command initiates a comprehensive performance review of the specified file. It will first read and analyze the code logic, data structures, and algorithms to pinpoint the primary area of inefficiency (the **bottleneck**). Next, it will provide concrete, actionable suggestions for improving the code's execution speed or resource usage. Finally, it will generate a separate script to allow the user to easily benchmark the current state and the optimized state.

üí° Example Use:
```bash
/analyze-performance src/app.js
