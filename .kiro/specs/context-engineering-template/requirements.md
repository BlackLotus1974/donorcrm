# Context Engineering Template - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Context Engineering Template is a comprehensive framework designed to help developers and AI systems create effective, structured context for complex software development tasks. This template will serve as a standardized approach to context creation, ensuring that all necessary information is captured and organized in a way that maximizes understanding and execution effectiveness.

The template addresses the critical need for systematic context engineering in modern software development, particularly when working with AI assistants, complex codebases, and multi-stakeholder projects. It provides a structured methodology for gathering, organizing, and presenting contextual information that enables better decision-making and more accurate implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Context Framework

**User Story:** As a developer working with AI systems, I want a standardized template for context engineering, so that I can consistently provide complete and well-structured context for any development task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating context for a development task THEN the template SHALL include all seven essential context components (Instructions, User Prompt, State/History, Long-term Memory, Retrieved Information, Available Tools, Structured Output)
2. WHEN using the template THEN it SHALL provide clear guidance on what information to include in each section
3. WHEN applying the template THEN it SHALL be adaptable to different types of development scenarios (debugging, feature development, code review, etc.)
4. WHEN completing the template THEN it SHALL result in actionable context that enables effective task execution

### Requirement 2: Header Section with Clear Purpose

**User Story:** As a team member reviewing context documentation, I want a clear header section that explains the purpose and key principles, so that I can quickly understand the scope and approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the template THEN it SHALL include a prominent header section with title and purpose statement
2. WHEN reading the header THEN it SHALL clearly articulate the key principles of effective context engineering
3. WHEN using the header section THEN it SHALL provide guidance on when and how to use the template
4. WHEN referencing the template THEN the header SHALL serve as a quick reference for core concepts

### Requirement 3: Context Components Checklist

**User Story:** As a developer creating context, I want a comprehensive checklist of all required context components, so that I can ensure I haven't missed any critical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the checklist THEN it SHALL include all seven context components with clear descriptions
2. WHEN completing each component THEN the checklist SHALL provide specific guidance on what information to include
3. WHEN reviewing context THEN the checklist SHALL serve as a validation tool to ensure completeness
4. WHEN working with complex scenarios THEN the checklist SHALL help prioritize which components are most critical

### Requirement 4: Planning Framework

**User Story:** As a project lead, I want a step-by-step planning framework, so that I can systematically build effective context for my team's development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning context creation THEN the framework SHALL provide a clear step-by-step process
2. WHEN following the framework THEN it SHALL guide users through logical progression from problem identification to context completion
3. WHEN using the planning framework THEN it SHALL include decision points and branching logic for different scenarios
4. WHEN implementing the framework THEN it SHALL be scalable from simple tasks to complex multi-phase projects

### Requirement 5: Quality Assessment Criteria

**User Story:** As a quality assurance professional, I want clear criteria for evaluating context quality, so that I can ensure context meets standards before task execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating context quality THEN the criteria SHALL provide measurable standards for completeness, clarity, and accuracy
2. WHEN applying quality assessment THEN it SHALL include both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods
3. WHEN reviewing context THEN the criteria SHALL help identify gaps or areas for improvement
4. WHEN using the assessment THEN it SHALL provide actionable feedback for context enhancement

### Requirement 6: Example Scenarios and Templates

**User Story:** As a developer new to context engineering, I want concrete examples and template sections for different use cases, so that I can quickly understand how to apply the framework in practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning the framework THEN it SHALL include at least 5 different scenario examples (debugging, feature development, code review, architecture planning, testing)
2. WHEN using examples THEN each SHALL demonstrate proper application of all context components
3. WHEN referencing scenarios THEN they SHALL be based on realistic development situations
4. WHEN applying examples THEN they SHALL serve as starting points that can be customized for specific needs

### Requirement 7: Implementation Notes and Best Practices

**User Story:** As an experienced developer, I want implementation notes and best practices, so that I can avoid common pitfalls and optimize my context engineering approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the template THEN it SHALL include documented best practices based on real-world usage
2. WHEN following implementation notes THEN they SHALL highlight common pitfalls and how to avoid them
3. WHEN using best practices THEN they SHALL provide optimization techniques for different team sizes and project types
4. WHEN referencing implementation guidance THEN it SHALL include troubleshooting tips for common issues

### Requirement 8: Integration with Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the context engineering template to integrate seamlessly with our existing development workflow, so that it enhances rather than disrupts our processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with workflows THEN the template SHALL be compatible with common development tools and processes
2. WHEN using in team environments THEN it SHALL support collaborative context creation and review
3. WHEN implementing in CI/CD pipelines THEN it SHALL provide hooks for automated context validation
4. WHEN scaling across projects THEN it SHALL maintain consistency while allowing for project-specific customization

### Requirement 9: Measurable Outcomes and Success Metrics

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to measure the effectiveness of context engineering, so that I can demonstrate value and continuously improve our approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring effectiveness THEN the template SHALL define clear success metrics for context quality
2. WHEN tracking outcomes THEN it SHALL provide methods for measuring task completion accuracy and efficiency
3. WHEN evaluating impact THEN it SHALL include metrics for team productivity and error reduction
4. WHEN reporting results THEN it SHALL provide templates for communicating context engineering value to stakeholders
